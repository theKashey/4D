# 4D
old school C++ stuff

This is quite old project. I abandon it more than 10 years ago, and just found in backup one day.

This is project from the days, when I was not JS, but C++ developer.

This is project from the days, when I start everything from the scratch over and over, to learn, and master programing.
  
This is project about many things. But unfortunately it is just a little part.
Everything else.. lost forever.
